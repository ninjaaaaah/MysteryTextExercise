You have two files: left.txt, and right.txt. Each one contains a series of numbers. You are to add the first number in left.txt to the first number in right.txt, the second number in left.txt to the second number in right.txt, and so on. When you have added them, you will have an ASCII value. Write the character this value corresponds to into a file called out.txt. eg: if left.txt contains 45 and right.txt contains 20, add them and you will get 65. 65 corresponds to the character "A", so write "A" to out.txt.

The files might contain letters as well--ignore these for the computations, but print them out. For example, if left.txt has "1 A 2 3" and right.txt has "4 5 B 6", you will compute 1 + 4, 2 + 5, and 3 + 6, write to out.txt, then print "A B". If you see letters in both files at the same time, the left one is printed first.

Submit both your java code and out.txt.

example:

left.txt contains:
45 J 46 47 48 V 49

right.txt contains:
20 20 A 20 20 A 20

Your program will
1. create out.txt, which contains the text "ABCDE"
2. print "JAVA"

Reminder: use print and NOT println. Newlines are already included in data, so there is no need to write your own newlines.
